Page UX	                       Landing Page Product-Pages	Purpose
Site Navigation	                       No	  Yes	          Because landing pages are most often used in advertisements
                                                             to drive targeted consumers back to a specific conversion,
                                                             landing pages strip the individual page of any other
                                                            click through opportunities outside of the main CTA. This includes removing site navigation.

Clear Call to Action (CTA)	 Yes	        Yes	  Both landing pages and product pages have a clear CTA (add to cart). On landing pages, 
                                                          however, this is the only CTA – and often uses language more targeted to the targeted audience 
                                                           being driven to the page.

Additional CTAs	                    No   	Yes	  Again, landing pages only have 1 CTA. Product pages often include a site navigation for additional
   + Additional Content                                      browsing as well as similar or related products. Many product pages include multiple lower-level
                                                           CTAs for those who are not yet ready for purchase.

Product Description          	Yes	        Yes	Both landing pages and product pages include additional product copy. On landing pages, however, 
                                                       the copy is often re-written for a specific audience, rather than a more general organic or direct audience.
